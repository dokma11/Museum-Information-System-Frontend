# Overview:
This is a frontend part of a project for course Information systems engineering.

Backend project can be found [here](https://github.com/dokma11/Museum-Information-System-Backend).

# Subdomains:
- <b>Artifact and item collections:</b> This subdomain represents a necessary strategy for the effective management of museum resources. 
It involves adding items, managing their locations and enabling loans of collection items to other institutions. Additionally, 
it enables item restoration.
- <b>Exhibitions:</b> This subdomain aims to enable curators and exhibition organizers to efficiently plan, organize and monitor exhibitions within the museum.
Exhibition management includes enabling curators and organizers to create new exhibitions, edit them or remove them.
- <b>Tours:</b> The tour subdomain includes the tour creation process by the organizer, tour edition and removal. 
After a tour is created, it is publicly available to all museum visitors and they have the opportunity to reserve their seats on that tour.
Additionally, visitors can request their own personal tours, which an organizer can accept or decline.
- <b>Events:</b> The responsibility of this subdomain is to enable and to the greatest extent automate the organization of events in the museum.
By organizing different types of events, the museum can attract a wider audience, even those that have little contact with historical cultural heritage.


# Technologies:
- <b>Angular:</b> A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
- <b>TypeScript:</b> A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, adding static types to enhance code quality and development efficiency.
- <b>HTML:</b> The standard markup language used for creating and structuring content on the web.
- <b>CSS:</b> A style sheet language used for describing the presentation and design of web pages, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- <b>npm:</b> The Node.js package manager that helps in installing, sharing, and managing dependencies and scripts for JavaScript projects
